# Reddit Basic

### Description
A basic copy of the website Reddit for a college assignment. In this project we were instructed to build a REST API using Nodejs and Typescript and Postgres as the database. We should also be able to run a Unit and Integration Test using Chai, Mocha and Supertest libraries. I have also used the Inversify framework to implement IOC (Inversion of Control) and Dependency Injection in this project.

The frontend is built with React and is being served on http://localhost:3001
